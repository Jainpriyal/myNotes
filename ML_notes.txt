Supervised learning: Classification, Regression

ID3: Top-down algorithm to induce a decision tree. Choose an attribute to split the sample which gives the maximum "information gain"
ID3 Bias(Inductive bias) Two type of biases 
    1) Restriction Bias -> the hypothesis set that we care about. H
    2) Preference bias -> tells us what source of hypothesis from this hypothesis set H, we prefer. h is subset of H
