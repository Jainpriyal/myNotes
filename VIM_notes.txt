Search and replace : http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace

Basic search and replace:
	:%s/foo/bar/g		Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
	:s/foo/bar/g		Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.
	:%s/foo/bar/gc		Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.
	:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc	Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:%s/foo/bar/gci		Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:%s/foo/bar/gcI		Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
	:5,12s/foo/bar/g	Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 5 to line 12 (inclusive).
