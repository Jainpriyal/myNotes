TO Read : The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf

Goal Interconnectivity: IP is the narrow waist. all protocols above and below it must conform to it, so that different devices operating on different protocols can communicate among themselves.

Goal Survivability: "network works even if devices fail"
    Achieved by : 1) replication
                  2) Fate Sharing - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate-sharing 
                  If a device fails all the state with it should be lost. (NAT violates it)

Goal Heterogeneity: TCP and UDP protocols 2) "Best effort" delivery
Goal Distributed Management: eg DNS and BGP. You take care of nodes below yourselves.
Other goals: COST, Ease of Attachment, Accountability.

End to End Argument: the network should be dumb and end application should be intelligent. 
e.g. Error handling in file transfer, end-to-end encryption, 
NAT violates end-to-end principle.  

SWITCHING: 
ARP: broadcast the IP, the machine with that particular IP will unicast with the MAC.
HUB: Problems: Too much collision and hence greater latency, Too much flooding packets, One misconfigured ruins the whole party.
SWITCH: Auto-configuring, layer 2(ethernet), Forwarding is fast.
    If there are cyles in toplogy, then it can lead to "loops" and "broadcast storms"
    Solution: Spanning Tree: Create a tree which contains all the switches. Instead of flooding, the switch will forward the packets along the spanning tree.
    Constructing a spanning tree: 
        1) Elect a root. ( The switch with smallest is elected by the fellow switches)
        2) At each switch, Exlude the link which is not a part of the shortest path to the root.
    Message Format: ('The node being claimed as root', 'distance of the particular node sending this message from the claimed root', 'the node sending this message')
ROUTERS: 

Buffer Sizing: How much buffering do switches and routers need? (2T * C), T is the round trip time between src and dest, and c is the bits/sec capacity of the bottleneck link.
Problem: 2T * C can be too much, increasing the cost; and more queing delay hence delayed feedback about congestion
Read more about this: Buffer sizing for a TCP sender.

ROUTING: the process by which nodes discover where to forward packets
    Routing inside an Autonomous system -> Intradomain routing; among different Autonomous systems (ASes)-> Interdomain routing
    An Autonomous system consists of Nodes, edges. Nodes are also called PoPs (Points of Presence)
    Intradomain routing is of two types: Distance Vector, Link State
    Distance Vector routing: 
        Each node sends its routing table to its neighbours.
        Routers compute cost to each destination based on shortest available path.
        Based on Bellman-Ford algorithm.
       Problem: Count to infinity problem. ( If you can't explain it to yourself then google it)
       Solution: Poision Reverse.
